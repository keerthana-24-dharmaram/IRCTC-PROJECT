This repository contains the implementation of an IRCTC Ticket Reservation System developed to demonstrate practical application of data structures and programming concepts. The project focuses on seat allocation, cancellation handling, RAC and waiting list management, and efficient data handling. This GitHub link is included in my resume for technical evaluation and code review purposes.
The project demonstrates a railway reservation system built using core data structures such as stacks, queues, deques, and trees. It implements booking workflows, cancellation handling, RAC promotion, waiting list processing, and traversal-based reporting in a structured manner.
